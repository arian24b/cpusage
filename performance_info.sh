echo "  âœ… Smart refresh: Only CPU data, not all system info"
echo "  âœ… UI throttling: Only update when values change >0.5%"

echo "  âœ… Link-time optimization (LTO) enabled"
echo "  âœ… Size optimization: Stripped debug symbols"

echo "ðŸ“Š Expected Performance:"
echo "  â€¢ CPU Usage: <0.1% (vs ~0.3% before)"

echo "  â€¢ Update frequency: 3-5 seconds (vs 2 seconds)"
echo "  â€¢ Binary size: ~330KB (optimized)"
